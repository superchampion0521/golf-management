        <h2>WHAT IS GEORGE'S METHOD?</h2>
        <p>
            The beauty in George's methodology is that he really doesn't have one. 
            Rather, George has developed a seemless and dynamic approach to crea-
            ting match ups for every skill level and physical make up. This coaching 
            process consists of four things. 1. creating efficient movement. 2. develop-
            ing speed and power 3. allowing statistics to drive practice. 4. building 
            complete players that are strong in all areas of the game.
